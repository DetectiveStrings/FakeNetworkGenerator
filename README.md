# FakeNetworkGenerator
Fake network generator tool, that I developed to create a CTF challenge, but this is the time to share the knowledge , however, you can use it to perform real attacks in your red teaming engage (currently it's low impact ,but the library still in progress )
this lib is mainly written to generate specific network scenarios so the person can analyse and learn the skill that he wants to. 
I'll be happy if anyone wants to add more features or edit anyone to improve the performance
